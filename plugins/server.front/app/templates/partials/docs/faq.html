<h3>What is OAuth.io?</h3>
<p>OAuth.ioâ€™s mission is to alleviate OAuth fragmentation in a practical way.<br />
Today we provide a web service that helps internet users to authenticate to and authorize third party web sites in an easy and secure way.</p>

<h3>What is OAuth</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p style="font-size: 0.9em">OAuth is an open standard for authorization. OAuth provides a method for clients to access server resources on behalf of a resource owner (such as a different client or an end-user). It also provides a process for end-users to authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials (typically, a username and password pair), using user-agent redirections.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>In practice, influential web companies could not wait for the IETF to finish the OAuth specification (whichever the version). This resulted in a huge fragmentation not only regarding the official versions of the protobut also regarding implementations that simply are not compliant with any of the specifications. Hence developers pain.</p>

<h3>What is your business model?</h3>
<p>During the beta version our goal is to gather product feedback, so the service is free.<br />
The business model will rely on a freemium model.</p>

<h3>How scalable is it?</h3>
<p>As scalable as Amazon allows it, that is scalable as hell!</p>

<h3>Is it production ready?</h3>
<p>Not yet. It is currently in beta version. If you want to use it in production, do it at your own risk.<br />
Please help us become production ready by testing it and giving us plenty of feedback.</p>

<h3>Why do you store my private keys?</h3>
<p>Currently, we need to store your API keys in order to authenticate/authorize your user. Think of OAuth.io as your OAuth backend. However, we are actively thinking on better ways to handle this in a privacy-friendly fashion.</p>

<h3>How secure is it?</h3>
<p>All requests are HTTPS, meaning that they are encrypted using TLS/SSL. This prevents anyone from hijacking a temporary but valid OAuth token.</p>

<h3>I want to become an OAuth provider.</h3>
<p>We did hear you :) Stay tuned!</p>

<h3>When will you support provider X?</h3>
<p>Have a look at the provider wishlist page. Simply star the providers you need or add them to the list. We tend to implement a few providers per week in an order that depends on both popularity and difficulty.</p>

<h3>Where can I hug you?</h3>
<p>We are currently in Paris, France. But we are often in San Francisco or in the API Days Conferences we organize worldwide (Paris, Madrid, San Francisco, Seatlle, Denver, London, Berlin). Shoot us an email if you want to meet!</p>
