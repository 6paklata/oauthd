				<h3>What is OAuth.io?</h3>
				<p>OAuth.io is an API for 80+ OAuth providers and our mission is  to alleviate OAuth fragmentation in a practical way for developers.<br />
				Technically, OAuth.io is a hosted version of oauthd, the open source OAuth daemon we started developing. The OAuth.io service runs on Amazon EC2 and provides an easy and simple web interface for developers to configure and consume their various OAuth providers in a unified way.</p>

				<h3>What is OAuth?</h3>
				<blockquote>
				    <p style="font-size: 0.9em">OAuth is an open standard for authorization. OAuth provides a method for clients to access server resources on behalf of a resource owner (such as a different client or an end-user). It also provides a process for end-users to authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials (typically, a username and password pair), using user-agent redirections.</p>
				    <small><cite title="wikipedia - OAuth"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">Wikipedia, OAuth</a></cite></small>
				</blockquote>

				<p>In practice, influential web companies could not wait for the IETF to finish the OAuth specification (whichever the version). This resulted in a huge fragmentation not only regarding the official versions of the protocol but also regarding implementations that simply are not compliant with any of the specifications. Hence developers pain.</p>

				<h3>What is the OAuth.io flow?</h3>
				<p>
				Your application calls OAuth.popup or OAuth.redirect in javascript. It does a request to oauth.io with the provider to connect.<br />
				Then OAuth.io sends the infos to popup/redirect to the provider's authorization form.<br />
				Once authorized, the provider redirects to oauth.io which will request the token and send back to the js callback in OAuth.popup / OAuth.callback<br />
				In a server-side flow, your application just receive a code that he send (in an ajax request) to his server.<br />
				Then the server requests oauth.io with his secret key to exchange the code for the token.
				</p>

				<h3>Why do you store my private keys?</h3>
				<p>OAuth.io is an OAuth backend as a service for your applications so that’s why we ask APIkeys of applications, like other Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS).</p>

				<h3>How secure is it?</h3>
				<p>Security is our highest priority in our mission to solve OAuth integration for developers. Security with performance and developer friendly experience.</p>

<p>OAuth.io is an OAuth backend-as-a-service for your applications so that’s why we ask APIkeys of applications, like other Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS).</p>

<p>What we can tell you about how we manage security on OAuth.io:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Everything is SSL EV encrypted, to secure the communitcation between oauth.io and the user.</li>
	<li>- The code is single use and with a short expiration time, so no third person will be able to re-use it</li>
	<li>- The valid domains/url depend on the detail level: the user can restrict to a single scheme/domain/port/path, so that the redirection cannot be cheated to leak an access token.</li>
	<li>- The "state" parameter is now mandatory when doing server-side auth, to avoid CSRF exploit.</li>
	<li>- The client-side/server-side (token/code) is decided in the app configuration, and not in the request, so that getting a token is not as easy as changing a request parameter.</li>
	<li>- We do not store any access_token to assure privacy in worst attack cases.</li>
	<li>- We have avoided url fragment leak (to get an access_token from a referer), a reason from recent facebook hacks.</li>
	<li>- We checked lots of CSRF/XSS potential security exploits and what we have done with Angular.js passed with success all tests</li>
	<li>- and globally, the website is API based/driven, so its security is easier to manage. </li>

<p>To be completely transparent for users which want to host their APIkeys, the code is open source and they can install the open source version of the daemon, called oauthd and accessible on Github <a href="https://github.com/oauth-io/oauthd">https://github.com/oauth-io/oauthd</a></p>

				<h3>How scalable is it?</h3>
				<p>We are on Amazon EC2.</p>

				<h3>Is it production ready?</h3>
				<p>Yes. We still accept feedback for improvements.</p>

				<h3>What is your business model?</h3>
				<p>Our model is a pay-as-you grow model (SaaS) You can see the pricing page here.<br />
				We also have a commecial licence model for people which want to run it on their own servers.</p>

				<h3>About the browser compatibility ?</h3>
				<p>We support most of the current browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE 10 (and partially IE 9), Android browser, Opera.</p>

				<h3>I want to become an OAuth provider.</h3>
				<p>Add you OAuth by contributing oauthd on github and we will release your OAuth on OAuth.io by accepting your pull-request</p>

				<h3>When will you support provider X?</h3>
				<p>Have a look at the provider <a href="/wishlist">wishlist page</a>. Simply +1 the providers you need or add them to the list. We tend to implement a few providers per week in an order that depends on both popularity and difficulty.</p>

				<h3>What is AGPL and what we can do with this open source licence?</h3>
				<p>oauthd is open source under Affero GPL license, the “GPL license for servers”, like MongoDB for example.</p>

				<p>Because oauthd is a stand alone running application as a daemon, so by installing oauthd, users have just to redistribute modifications they have made of oauthd under the same open source licence, and not all the code of the project as other classical GPL license.</p>

				<p>That means:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>- all open source projects can use oauthd for their apps and projects.</li>
					<li>- closed source projects using oauthd as a stand-alone server needs to redistribute in open source only modifications of oauthd</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We provide a commercial license for companies that are interested to have oauthd into their server keep close the modifications they have made on oauthd or the code they linked to oauthd.<br />The prize of the commercial license depends on the support service required.</p>

				<h3>What is on the roadmap</h3>
				<p>Our next step is going on mobile with iOS, Android and BlackBerry SDKs. We have received hundreds of mails asking to go on mobile first, before other languages.<br />Then we will make the other Python, Ruby, PHP, .NET and Java SDK until the end of the year.</p>

				<h3>Where can I hug you?</h3>
				<p>Somewhere between San Francisco or Paris, or during API Days Conferences we organize worldwide (Paris, Madrid, San Francisco). Shoot us an email if you want to meet us!</p>
